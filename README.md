# Ex.3: Directed and Edge-Weighted Graphs
# introduction:
This task is dedicated to the design and implementation of data structures and algorithms on graphs (directed and weighted) in Python.

**Directed Graph:**

A directed graph is a graph, a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one ***vertex** to another. A directed graph is sometimes called a digraph or a directed network. A directed graph is a graph in which the edges have a direction. This is usually indicated with an arrow on the edge; more formally, if v and w are vertices, an edge is an unordered pair {v,w}, while a ***directed edge**, called an arc, is an ordered pair (v,w) or (w,v). The arc (v,w) is drawn as an arrow from v to w. If a graph contains both arcs (v,w) and (w,v), this is not a "multiple edge'', as the arcs are distinct. It is possible to have multiple arcs, namely, an arc (v,w) may be included multiple times in the multiset of arcs. As before, a digraph is called simple if there are no loops or multiple arcs.

**Edge-Weighted Graphs:**

An edge-weighted graph is a graph in which each edge has been assigned a ***weight**. Similarly, a vertex-weighted graph is a graph in which each vertex has been assigned a weight. In such graphs, the quantity represented by a weight depends on the application. In many applications, each edge of a graph has an associated numerical value, called a weight. Usually, the edge weights are nonnegative integers. Weighted graphs may be either directed or undirected. The weight of an edge is often referred to as the "cost" of the edge. In applications, the weight may be a measure of the length of a route, the capacity of a line, the energy required to move between locations along a route, etc.the combination of Directed Graphs and Edge-Weighted Graphs is called Edge-Weighted Digraphs.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
***Vertex** – Is a node on a graph. 

***Directed Edge** – Is a link between two vertices. Directed edge is always pointing the same way. It has a source and a destination. 

***Weight** – Represents the cost of the edge.
