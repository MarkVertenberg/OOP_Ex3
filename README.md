# Ex.3: Directed and Edge-Weighted Graphs
# introduction:
This task is dedicated to the design and implementation of data structures and algorithms on graphs (directed and weighted).

Directed Graph:

A directed graph is a graph, a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another. A directed graph is sometimes called a digraph or a directed network. 

Edge-Weighted Graphs:

An edge-weighted graph   is a graph in which each edge has been assigned a weight. Similarly, a vertex-weighted graph   is a graph in which each vertex has been assigned a weight. In such graphs, the quantity represented by a weight depends on the application.

the combination of Directed Graphs and Edge-Weighted Graphs is called
Edge-Weighted Digraphs.


Details of the terms:

Vertex – Is a node on a graph. 
Directed Edge – Is a link between two vertices. Directed edge is always pointing the same way. It has a source and a destination. 
Weight – Represents the cost of the edge.
